# Doku
Doku is a Sudoku solver that I wrote as a project to learn the Rust programming language with.

It's still very incomplete. And besides still learning Rust, I'm also not that good at solving Sudoku puzzles, so I'm coming up with the design of the app as I go along. Manage your expectations.

## Planned features

* More solution strategies such as intersections, naked pairs/tripples/etc., hidden pairs/tripples/etc., x-wings...
* Nicer presentation of the grid using something like OpenGL or SDL2
* Showing solutions step by step (e.g., "this is a naked pair for 2 & 7, so these other cells can't be 2 or 7")
